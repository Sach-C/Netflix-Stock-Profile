# Netflix-Stock-Profile
 This project has an emphasis on visualisations by doing a stock profile on Netflix' stock data (a series of visualisations, studies and analyses that go into different aspects a publicly traded company's data).

 The financial data source is: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DATA/)

For the purposes of this project, I will visualise data for the year, 2017. 
Specifically, I will creating the following visualisations:
+ The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
+ Netflix's Earnings and Revenue in the last four quarters
+ The Actual vs. Estimated Earnings per Share for the four quarters in 2017
+ A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017 

These Seaborn and Matplotlib visualisations would be to help financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.
